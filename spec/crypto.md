## Cryptographic protocols

### Terminology

_TODO: general terms here_

 - We use `PRNG(size)` to reference an invocation of a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator requiring the generation of a random integer in the range `[0, size-1]`. Alternatively we use `PRNG(min, max)` to refer to the generation of a random integer in the range `[min, max]`.

### Protocols

Most protocols described here are zero-knowledge proofs for different statements. They follow the patterns of three-move rounds protocols with a commit, a challenge and a response phase which we shall describe as three separate algorithms. The challenge phase is unique, whereas the commit and response phases have a specific instance for each of the statements being proved.

#### Issuer Setup

The issuer setup consists of a set of algorithms to generate the Issuer Public Key. The set of algorithms are:

 - `CredentialKeyGen` is used by the Issuer to generate the credential public/private keypair.
 - `RevocationKeyGen` is used by the Issuer to generate the revocation public/private keypair.

The reference implementation of `CredentialKeyGen` is [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/ece6ce32a59df4e1f99fa38243c1236423066bc2/libursa/src/cl/issuer.rs#L774-L832).

```bash

( PK, SK ) = CredentialKeyGen( L )

Inputs:

 - L, the total number of attributes signed by this issuer

Parameters:

 -

Definitions:

 - l_n, the bitlength of the RSA modulus n of the issuer public key

Outputs:

 - PK, the credential public key of the issuer
 - SK, the credential secret key of the issuer

Procedure:

 1. p = SafePrime(l_n/2)                     # Generate a safe prime

 2. q = SafePrime(l_n/2)                     # Generate a safe prime

 3. n = p * q                                # The RSA modulus

 4. p' = (p-1)/2                             # The Sophie Germain prime of p

 5. q' = (q-1)/2                             # The Sophie Germain prime of q

 6. S = PRNG(l_n)^2 (mod n)                  # A quadratic residue mod n, it generates the subgroup mod n of size p' * q'

 7. Z = S^{PRNG(2, p'*q' - 1)} (mod n)       # The term Z of the CL public key

 8. R = ()                                   # Initialise the set of terms R_i of the CL public key

 9. foreach j in (1, ..., L):

10. R = R + {S^{PRNG(2, p'*q' - 1)} (mod n)} # Generate R_j

11. PK = ( n, S, Z, R )

12. SK = ( p, q )

13. return ( PK, SK )

```

#### Proving knowledge of a signature with selective disclosure of messages (`ProveCL`)

`ProveCLCommit` and `ProveCLResponse` are used by a Holder who possesses one or more signatures from one or more Issuers and uses them to derive a proof of knowledge for them. The algorithms are invoked once per signature.

_TODO: considerations about the algorithm and its security_

_TODO: clarify exact format and encoding of inputs and outputs_

The reference implementation of `ProveCLCommit` is [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/ece6ce32a59df4e1f99fa38243c1236423066bc2/libursa/src/cl/prover.rs#L1313-L1394).

 8. v' = v - e * r                           # recompute v given the randomisation

 9. e' = e - 2^{l_e - 1}                     # prepare value to prove that e is positive

10. e~ = PRNG(l'_e + l_0 + l_H)              # random for t-value of the signature

11. v~ = PRNG(l_v + l_0 + l_H)               # random for t-value of the signature

12. Z~ = A'^{e~} * S^{v~} mod n              # compute t-value for the signature
