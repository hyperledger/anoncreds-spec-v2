## Abstract

The AnonCreds (Anonymous Credentials) specification is based on the open source verifiable credential
implementation of AnonCreds that has been in use since 2017, initially as part of the
[Hyperledger Indy](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/hyperledger-indy) open
source project and now in the [Hyperledger AnonCreds](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/anoncreds) project. The extensive use of AnonCreds around the world has made it a de
facto standard for ZKP-based verifiable credentials, and this specification is the
formalization of that implementation.

The goal of AnonCreds v1.0 is the definition of a ledger-agnostic specification of the existing AnonCreds implementation.

The goal of AnonCreds v2.0 is to retain and extend the privacy-preserving features of AnonCreds v1.0, while improving capabilities, performance, extensibility, and security.

For more details on what AnonCreds are and how they work you can refer to the [_Anonymous credentials with type-3 revocation_ by Dmitry Khovratovisch, Michael Lodder and Cam Parra](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-spec/blob/main/spec/ursaAnonCreds.pdf) which is the compiled pdf from their [official TeX document](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa-docs/tree/main/specs/anoncreds1) published under CC4.0 license.
