# Scope

This document outlines the scope of work undertaken by the AnonCreds Open Specification Working Group.

## Objectives

The objective of this Working Group is to document the AnonCreds v2.0 Specification. The goal of AnonCreds v2.0 is to retain and extend the privacy-preserving features of AnonCreds v1.0, while improving capabilities, performance, extensibility, and security.

### v1.0

The AnonCreds v1.0 Specification provides, as a main difference to v0.1, the decoupling from the Indy ledger. It aims at being entirely ledger-agnostic. Non-goals of this version are changes to the CL signatures signing algorithm in the sense that this will remain the single supported cryptographic signature suite.

## Background/Context

Since 2017, many organizations across the globe have been implementing verifiable credential-based solutions using the AnonCreds (Anonymous Credentials) implementation that was built into the Hyperledger Indy open source project. AnonCreds provides capabilities that many see as important for digital identity use cases in particular, and verifiable data in general. These features include:

- A full implementation of the Layer 3 verifiable credential “Trust Triangle” of the [Trust over IP Model](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/).
- Complete flows for issuing verifiable credentials (Issuer to Holder), and requesting, generating and verifying presentations of verifiable claims (Holder to Verifier) as well as revocation capabilities.
- Fully defined data models for all of the objects in the flows, including verifiable credentials, presentation requests and presentations sourced from multiple credentials.
- Fully defined applications of cryptographic primitives.
- The use of Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in the verifiable presentation process to enhance the privacy protections available to the holder in presenting data to verifiers, including:
  - Blinding issuer signatures to prevent correlation based on those signatures.
  - The use of unrevealed identifiers for holder binding to prevent correlation based on such identifiers.
  - The use of predicate proofs to reduce the sharing of PII and potentially correlating data, especially dates (birth, credential issuance/expiry, etc.).
  - A revocation scheme that proves a presentation is based on credentials that have not been revoked by the issuers without revealing correlatable revocation identifiers.

While AnonCreds is open source and has become a de facto standard, it is not an open specification. Some in the larger self-sovereign identity community view AnonCreds as proprietary. Others are concerned that it is only open source, and subject to change by any code maintainer. The focus of this Working Group is to make AnonCreds an open specification and remove those barriers to broader adoption. As well, unsuccessful attempts have been made to align AnonCreds with the W3C Verifiable Credential Data Model v1.x, larger because of some core differences in the two approaches to verifiable credentials.

Initial work of the group will focus on putting into specification form the existing implementation of AnonCreds as found in the two existing Indy implementations. Part of that work will be the removal of all dependencies in the specification on the remote storage of objects, including Hyperledger Indy ledger. There is no technical requirement to require Indy in implementing AnonCreds, although there may be some identifiers that may have to be renamed because of Indy-isms in the identifiers.

Subsequent work will be on a new AnonCreds specification that has the goal of keeping the capabilities of the current AnonCreds, while updating the underlying primitives, such as replacing CL-Signatures with BBS+ Signatures and defining a more scalable revocation scheme. To be determined by the working group is whether and how the standard might produce artifacts that align with the in-process W3C VC v2.0 data model standard.

## Milestones

Key milestones will include, but are not limited to:

1. Publication of the first Draft AnonCreds v2.0 Deliverable from a generated GitHub repository.
2. Publication of the final Draft AnonCreds v2.0 Deliverable.
3. Approval of the Draft AnonCreds v2.0 Deliverable as a Working Group Approved Deliverable.
4. The placement of the AnonCreds v2.0 Specification on the standards track of an SDO.

## Dependencies

- The AnonCreds v1.0 MUST align with the existing AnonCreds open source implementations in Hyperledger AnonCreds ([anoncreds-rs](https://github.com/hyperledger/anoncreds-rs) repo) and be Verifiable Data Registry-agnostic.
- The Hyperledger Aries Issue Credential ([v1](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0036-issue-credential/README.md), [v2](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0453-issue-credential-v2/README.md)) and Present Proof ([v1](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0037-present-proof/README.md), [v2](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0454-present-proof-v2/README.md)) protocols defined in the [Aries RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs) repository of standards and protocols.

This Scope is important is it establishes the bounds of each contributor's and
licensee's patent commitment. For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you
may find [ISO's guidance (see page 5)](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf "ISO How To Write Standards Guide") helpful.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
